# Simple-VR-Bowling-
An VR Bowling game made with Unity to run on Oculus and windows mixed reality headsets. \
NOTE: It is still a work in progress. If you have unity installed, go to file  then build settings then select Android and click the build button #
Plug in your VR headset and try it out. Also, you must have enable developer mode for your Oculus or Windows XR Device before playing. \
Thanks!
